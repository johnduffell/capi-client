# Welcome to our toy CAPI playground

Over the course of the coming weeks, we'll be writing a little interpreter for CAPI queries. In doing so, we'll have to grok several recurring concepts in Haskell applications and put them to good use.

So, let's get started. In order to work in this project, you will need to install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). Once that is done, in this project's root folder:

- run `stack setup`
- run `stack build --file-watch`
- get cracking!
